//then the file is then stored into a list
//we'll have to return the list at the end

//then we'll have to write the file using the writefile object
//probably gonna have to make a loop to loop the size of the list
//also count mods here for the console output
//and then write the file

//the # of modifications will have to get printed out to the console
